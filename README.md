# ShadowProject - Design of Robotic Arm

Problem Statement
To design a robotic arm with 3 axes capable of moving mass of 1 kg with speeds up to 1 m/s.



About the project
The robotic arm structure selected for the design is RRP structure (2 revolute and 1 prismatic joint). This type of structure comes under the robot called as SCARA (Selective Compliant Articulated Robot for Assembly). The SCARA robot having all the axis parallel to each other. It is most widely used in all type of industries for pick and place operation with high speed and high accuracy.
